# Euler Method with Derivative Calculation

This project demonstrates the Euler Method for solving equations. It computes approximate values and derivatives step by step, comparing results to the exact solution.

## Features

- Approximates values using the Euler Method.
- Displays derivatives for each step.
- Shows the relative difference from the exact solution.

## Usage

Save the file and run it in a Python environment. Outputs include the approximate values, derivatives, and relative differences.
